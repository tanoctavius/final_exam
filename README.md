# Personal Research Portal (Local RAG) - For Final Exam (Octavius Tan otan)

**Adapted Phase 3 Submission for Final Exam**

A local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) web application that uses **DeepSeek-R1** and **Llama 3.2** to analyze research papers. It wraps professional-grade retrieval techniques (Hybrid Search + Reranking) into a complete, interactive Streamlit UI featuring agentic research loops, automated artifact generation, and dynamic knowledge graph visualizations.

## Prerequisites

To run, you must have the following installed:

1.  **Ollama**: This application runs the Large Language Model locally.
    * Download from: https://ollama.com
    * Verify installation by running `ollama --version` in your terminal.
2.  **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher.
3.  **Git**: To clone this repository.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/tanoctavius/final_exam.git](https://github.com/tanoctavius/final_exam.git)
cd final_exam

```

### 2. Install Dependencies
We HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend doing it in a venv so you have a completely fresh place (very painful if not) due to req mismatches.

```bash
conda create -n final_exam python=3.10 -y
conda activate final_exam
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Pull the AI Models

Open your terminal and run these commands to download Deepseek and the embedding model required for the vector database:

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

```

## Configuration and Data Setup

### 1. Add Your Files (We ald have 20 uploaded)

Place your PDF (`.pdf`) or Text (`.txt`) files into the `data/raw/` folder.

### 2. Update the Manifest

Open `data/data_manifest.csv`. Every file must have a corresponding entry. This manifest is the "Source of Truth" for the Structured Citation system.

**CSV Format:**

```csv
source_id, title, authors, year, type, link/ DOI, raw_path, relevance, in_text_citation
Zhang2025, "Emoti-Attack", "Yangshijie Zhang", 2025, Paper, https://arxiv.org/..., data/raw/Zhang2025.pdf, "Note...", "(Zhang, 2025)"

```

*Note: Ensure titles are enclosed in double quotes if they contain commas. (Will mess up csv parsing if not)*

### 3. Build the Hybrid Database

This script performs Semantic Chunking and builds both the FAISS (Vector) and BM25 (Keyword) indices.

```bash
python ingest.py

```

## Usage for terminal

Run the main chat interface:

```bash
python rag_pipeline.py

```

1. Wait for the prompt `research portal phase 2...` to appear.
2. Type your question (e.g., "What does Zhang say about emoji attacks?").
3. The AI will answer and provide citations in the format `(Paper, Chunk, In_text_citation)`.
4. Toggle Reasoning: Type `toggle think` to show/hide DeepSeek's internal thought process.
5. Type `quit` or `exit` to close the program.


## Usage (UI)

Launch the full-stack Research Portal interface:

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py

Notes on UI: 
The application is divided into five main tabs and a sidebar tool palette:

1. 💬 Synthesis Chat: The main interface. Ask questions to retrieve evidence and generate cited responses. Toggle the "View AI Thought Process" expander to see DeepSeek-R1's internal reasoning.

2. 🕸️ Knowledge Graph: Visualizes relationships between your research queries, source documents, and authors. Toggle between the "Recent" (last query only) and "Cumulative" (entire session) networks.

3. 🔍 Gap Finder: Evaluates the retrieved context against your specific question to highlight missing information and suggests targeted evidence needed to resolve those gaps.

4. 📊 Evaluation: View historical RAGAs metrics from your offline evaluation scripts, or run an on-the-fly evaluation using Llama 3.2 to grade the Faithfulness and Relevancy of your most recent chat interaction.

5. ℹ️ Info: A system architecture breakdown and user guide.

Sidebar Tools
Enable Agentic Deep Loop: When toggled on, the system breaks complex questions into search-optimized sub-queries, executes parallel searches, and synthesizes a comprehensive final answer.

Export Capabilities: Download your current chat thread as a Markdown file, or export your corpus metadata as a formatted BibTeX reference list.

Artifact Generator: Automatically transform the evidence retrieved from your last query into formal academic structures (Evidence Tables, Annotated Bibliographies, or Synthesis Memos).


Characteristics:
1. Hybrid Search: Balances keyword accuracy (BM25) with semantic meaning (FAISS).

2. Cross-Encoder Reranking: Re-scores top results to ensure only the most relevant context is sent to the LLM.

3. Automatic Bibliography: Every answer resolves internal tags into a readable (Author, Year) format and appends a References section.

4. Production Logging: Every query, response, and latency metric is saved to logs/rag_logs.csv.


## Advanced Evaluation (2-Step Checkpointing)

To handle the high latency of reasoning models, the evaluation is split into two phases. This allows us to generate answers once and grade them multiple times without re-running the LLM.

Phase 1: Generation
Generates answers for 22 benchmark queries and caches them to logs/generation_cache.json.

```bash
python generate_answers.py
```

Phase 2: Grading
Uses Llama 3.2 to grade the cached answers against RAGAs metrics (Faithfulness and Relevancy).

```bash
python evaluation.py
```

## Stretch Goals Implemented (Phase 2)

1. **Hybrid Retrieval (BM25 + FAISS)**: Merges traditional search with vector embeddings to catch both technical terms and general concepts.

2. **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Utilizes ms-marco-MiniLM to re-rank the top 20 retrieved chunks down to the best 5.

3. **Semantic Chunking**: Breaks documents at logical semantic shifts using AI embeddings instead of arbitrary character counts.

4. **Structured Citations**: A custom post-processing loop that maps internal IDs to your manifest's in_text_citation column.

## Stretch Goals Implemented (Phase 3)

1. **Interactive Web Interface (Streamlit)**: Upgraded from a CLI script to a polished, multi-tab web portal with expandable evidence and reasoning traces.

2. **Agentic Research Loop**: An autonomous planning step that decomposes complex user queries into parallel sub-queries for broader evidence retrieval before final synthesis.

3. **Dynamic Knowledge Graph**: Uses `networkx` and `Plotly` to map out relationships between queries, source documents, and authors both for individual queries and cumulatively across a session.

4. **Automated Gap Finding**: A dedicated LLM chain that specifically analyzes retrieved context to identify logical gaps and missing evidence required to fully answer the user's prompt.

5. **Research Artifact Generation**: Prompt-engineered pipelines that instantly convert retrieved contexts into Evidence Tables, Annotated Bibliographies, and Synthesis Memos.

6. **BibTeX Export**: A one-click utility to export the structured CSV metadata manifest into a standardized `.bib` format for reference managers.

7. **On-Demand RAGAs Evaluation**: Integrated the RAGAs framework directly into the UI, allowing users to manually grade the Faithfulness and Answer Relevancy of their latest query without leaving the app.

## Understanding the Evaluation Metrics

This project uses **RAGAs (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment)** to grade the performance of the system. Since we use a "Judge" LLM (Llama 3.2) to grade the "Generator" LLM (DeepSeek-R1), the scores reflect a nuanced understanding of research accuracy.

### 1. Faithfulness (0.0 to 1.0)

* **Definition:** Measures **Hallucination**. It checks if every claim made in the answer can be inferred from the retrieved context.
* **How it works:** The Judge breaks the answer into individual claims and verifies if each claim exists in the provided source text.
* **Score of 1.0:** The model acted as a perfect research assistant; it only used the provided papers and made nothing up.
* **Score of 0.0:** The model hallucinated information not present in the source documents.

### 2. Answer Relevancy (0.0 to 1.0)

* **Definition:** Measures **Directness**. It checks if the response actually addresses the user's query.
* **How it works:** The Judge generates hypothetical questions based on the answer and calculates the semantic similarity to the original query.
* **Score of 1.0:** The answer is direct and to the point.
* **Score of 0.0:** The model dodged the question, provided irrelevant info, or stated "I don't know."

### 3. Interpreting Your Results

When you look at `logs/evaluation_results.csv`, use this guide to diagnose performance:

| Faithfulness | Relevancy | Status | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **High (~1.0)** | **High (~0.8+)** | ✅ **Success** | The system found the paper and answered correctly. |
| **High (1.0)** | **Low (0.0)** | 🛡️ **Safe Failure** | The system could not find the answer in the text and correctly refused to answer (e.g., "The provided context does not mention..."). This is preferred over hallucination. |
| **Low (<0.5)** | **High (~0.8+)** | ⚠️ **Hallucination** | The system answered the question confidently but used information **not** in the papers. This is dangerous for research. |
| **Low (<0.5)** | **Low (<0.5)** | ❌ **Failure** | The system failed to retrieve relevant documents and gave a confused response. |

### Note on "Edge Case" Queries

For queries like *"How many chickens fit in CMU?"*, a score of **Faithfulness: 1.0 / Relevancy: 0.0** is the **ideal outcome**. It means the model truthfully stated it didn't know (Faithful) and correctly identified that the context was irrelevant to chickens (Low Relevancy to the user's intent of getting a number).
